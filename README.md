# Geocache
Geocaching app for Comp225

### Find Coordinates Method 
This Method is needed by both the map and the compass. Currently, there is an issue with defining "this" and it appears there is confusion within the code about state (as Map View sets a state, that is different than the state the current compass is requesting for). This method works when putting Compass and Map in their own apps. 
### Map Screen 
Currently screen works, but needs to be adpated for user purposes. Warning occurs, and source appears to be from Find Coordinates Method in combination with the compass class.
